      <h1>WHO ARE THE LEAGUE OF HEROES?</h1>
        <p>The League of Heroes is a band of Earth's mightiest costumed superheroes, who use their
          superpowers for good, fighting evil in all its forms.</p>
        <p>The League was founded in Toronto, Canada, by Dr. Goliath and his belief that he could make a
          better world, and that the law abiding public deserve more.</p>
        <p>Since our debut on the world stage in 2015 we have established ourselves as the first and
          foremost superhero team.</p>

      <h2>HOW IT ALL BEGAN?</h2>
      <!-- <img src="images/fortress-of-justice.jpg" alt="fort"> -->
      <p>In September 2014, Dr. Goliath left his position as a senior webmaster at Seneca College and
        dedicated himself to full time crime fighting.</p>
      <p>He gathered a team of people with the skills and temperament to make the venture a success.
        The League's first year was spent consolidating funding, acquiring expertise and equipment, as
        well as constructing the Fortress of Justice.</p>
