			<p>For my design, I choose to make a Website on Immigration and visa process. I moved to Canada last year and I saw a huge craze of moving to Canada. I might be a little biased but I think Canada is the most immigrant-friendly country in the world. And Canada's welcoming attitude is attracting more immigrants annually. And particularly Asian people are more attracted towards it.</p>
			<h4>Audience for the site</h4>
			<p>A huge audience is expected because, on this website, I have tried to cover the students, visitors, immigrants, personal assistance and other pre and post-landing services. These are the things that I have searched and most of the people are asking us.</p>
			<p>There are certain <b>KEYWORDS</b> from where people start searching. To make my website visible, I have included them.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Visa</li>
				<li>Immigration</li>
				<li>Study visa</li>
				<li>Citizenship</li>
				<li>Best country to immigrate</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Immigrant population of Canada - 7,202,340 immigrants</h4>

			<h4>Site Metaphore:</h4>
			<p>This website can help anybody who wants to move to another country, whatever the reason is. From scheduling to post landing, all the services are included which are generally not available in many popular sites.</p>
			<p>I tried to make the website very <b>simple</b> so that anybody can get the main things on clicking the website. Further links are given afterward. I included the contact number within the header itself, so make us approachable. On the first page I included the bright picture of CN tower, which <b><i>attracts the audience</i></b> to explore more.</p>
		
			<h4>Reason for content-based features</h4>
			<p>Content-based features were used so that the focus can be given to content rather than language e.g. the inquiry form looked like a form and in contact us there is google map, facebook and twitter links.</p>
			
			
			<h4>Reason for style-based features</h4>
			<p>In this website, <b>FLEXBOX</b> was the main styling feature. To place the divs in perfect place, this is the most covenient and accurate method. The space between or around can be adjusted without margins.</p>
			
			<h4>Obstacles and Challenges</h4>
			<p>- I wanted to add more details about the documents needed but those were beyond my current knowledge and access.</p> 
			<p>- I wanted to add the links from Government of Canada(official website), but I didn't know whether that was legal or not.</p>
			<p>- I wanted to make the point calculator for the immigration and visa process, but I don't know how to make it. And for the temporary measure, I didn't attempt.</p>
